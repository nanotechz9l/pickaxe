I have an awesome idea for us to come up with this summer. It is called threatsight. Its a web application that performs, and collects threat 
intelligence for an enterprise. Some of the key features is APT research, malware evolution, and modern attacks. Its all rails based, and is
going to be wicked cool to code up.
